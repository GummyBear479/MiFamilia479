# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Guide for MiFamilia479

## Project Overview

**MiFamilia479** is a newly initialized repository owned by GummyBear479. The project is in its early stages with no source code, build system, or dependencies configured yet. This file serves as the foundational guide for AI assistants contributing to this repository.

## Repository Structure

```
MiFamilia479/
├── CLAUDE.md          # AI assistant guide (this file)
├── README.md          # Project documentation
└── .git/              # Git metadata
```

As the project grows, this section should be updated to reflect the actual directory layout (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `config/`).

## Development Setup

No build system or package manager is currently configured. When one is added, document the setup steps here:

- **Prerequisites:** (e.g., Node.js >= 18, Python 3.11+, etc.)
- **Install dependencies:** (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- **Run development server:** (TBD)
- **Run tests:** (TBD)
- **Build for production:** (TBD)

## Key Commands

No scripts or commands are configured yet. Update this section as they are added:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| TBD     | TBD         |

## Code Conventions

### Git Workflow

- **Default branch:** `main`
- **Feature branches:** Use `claude/<description>-<id>` pattern for AI-assisted branches
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages focused on "why" not just "what"
- Keep commits atomic - one logical change per commit

### Style Guidelines

No linter or formatter is configured yet. When established, document:

- Language-specific style rules
- Linting tool and configuration file location
- Formatting tool and configuration file location
- Pre-commit hooks if any

## Architecture

No architecture decisions have been made yet. As the project develops, document:

- Tech stack choices and rationale
- High-level architecture patterns (e.g., MVC, microservices, monorepo)
- Key modules and their responsibilities
- Data flow and state management approach
- External service integrations

## Testing

No testing framework is configured. When added, document:

- Testing framework and runner
- Test file naming conventions (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `*_test.py`)
- Test directory structure
- How to run the full test suite vs individual tests
- Coverage requirements

## CI/CD

No CI/CD pipelines are configured. When added, document:

- Pipeline configuration file locations
- Build and deploy stages
- Required checks before merging

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

1. **Read before modifying** - Always read files before suggesting changes
2. **Minimal changes** - Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary
3. **No over-engineering** - Keep solutions simple and focused on the task at hand
4. **Security first** - Never commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data
5. **Update this file** - When you add significant structure, tooling, or conventions to this repo, update CLAUDE.md to reflect the current state
6. **Check README.md** - Keep README.md in sync with project changes
